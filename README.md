## Setup

installing depencies

```bash
yarn
```

## Live demo

i deployed the app on netlify : <a href="" target="_blank">web app</a>

## Tech Choices

- setup project with typescript eslint prettier and husky for better clean code
- react bootstrap as component library
- css for style customization
- react query :Fetch, cache and update data (alternative to graphql)
- no redux: i didn't use Redux and the reason is simpele the app doesn't has any concrete global state , and am not the kind of developer who store everything on redux, each library has his own context of use (check react query for caching data)

## Priorities

in the short time that i had i couldn't build the app in the way i like so i couldn't:

- implement some test with jest and testing-library
- take care of respponsivity
- more stric typed app (special;y on the fetching data)

i had to prioritize more core requirements for the time that i had

## Demand

please i like to listen a feedback about my code. i accept any remarks and am open to suggestions. thank you
